                    ======3x24 Part One:======
                      ======  Retreat ======

Details: My entry to BeginningVille, the first in the 3x24 Series. It consists of two maps; retreat_a and retreat_b.


Story: Awoken in the middle of the night, you find that your hideout is being raided by the Combine. Hopelessly outnumbered, you have no choice but to retreat into the forest and try to find safety. Your journey  will see you using a car, exploring dark mines and travelling by several other means.

Custom content: includes custom materials, .vcd script files and custom voice acting.

Known Bugs: The first map uses console commands to reduce the damage taken from the APC and to create a slow-motion effect. These have been known not to trigger in some cases, especially after loading a saved game. 
The way in which the level transition works means you may not spawn in the correct location in map 2. If this happens, open the console and type "map retreat_b_pp_3x24".


***Look out for the continuation of the story in the next 3x24 competition (hopefully!)...***
