*** Secret of the Coast***
    by Alastair Toft

"The cliffs hold a dark secret..."

Setting and story: Set on a quiet coastline in late afternoon, it is up to you to climb islands, descend cliffs
                   and explore the mysteries of the Coast.

Information:       This map is similar in style and pacing to my last competition entry, Gravity Falls. In fact,
(spoilers)         some of the similarities are unintentional and I didn't realise until late in development.
                   The main vertical elements are the cliffs which make up a large portion of gameplay, and the
                   Combine excavation you must descend into, but there are also a couple of flat open areas.
                   I was quite short on time in developing this map due to other commitments and most of my
                   testing time was spent trying to fix severe lighting problems and Hammer crashes. I am 
                   surprised I managed to finish it at all!

Custom content:    The map includes 2 custom textures I created, which aim to add backstory and act as a hint.

Notes:             Did you spot the Gman's first appearance?

Thanks and have fun!
